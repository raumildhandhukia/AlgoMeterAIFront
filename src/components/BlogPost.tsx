          Introduction to Time Complexity Analysis
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Time complexity analysis is a fundamental concept in computer science
          that helps developers understand and optimize the performance of their
          algorithms. By analyzing time complexity, we can predict how the
          runtime of an algorithm will grow as the input size increases. This
          knowledge is crucial for designing efficient solutions to complex
          problems.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">Big O Notation</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          At the heart of time complexity analysis is Big O notation. This
          mathematical notation describes the upper bound of an algorithm's
          growth rate. When we say an algorithm has O(n) time complexity, we
          mean its runtime grows linearly with the input size. Common Big O
          notations include:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
          <li>O(1): Constant time</li>
          <li>O(log n): Logarithmic time</li>
          <li>O(n): Linear time</li>
          <li>O(n log n): Linearithmic time</li>
          <li>O(n²): Quadratic time</li>
          <li>O(2ⁿ): Exponential time</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">
          Worst-Case, Average-Case, and Best-Case Scenarios
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          When analyzing time complexity, we often consider different scenarios:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
          <li>
            <strong>Worst-case scenario:</strong> The maximum time the algorithm
            will take for any input of size n.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Average-case scenario:</strong> The expected time the
            algorithm will take for a typical input of size n.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Best-case scenario:</strong> The minimum time the algorithm
            will take for any input of size n.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">
          While all scenarios are important, we often focus on worst-case
          analysis as it provides an upper bound on the algorithm's performance.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">Asymptotic Analysis</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Asymptotic analysis focuses on the behavior of algorithms as the input
          size approaches infinity. This approach allows us to ignore constant
          factors and lower-order terms, simplifying our analysis. For example,
          an algorithm with a time complexity of 3n² + 2n + 1 would be
          simplified to O(n²) in asymptotic analysis.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">Space Complexity</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          While time complexity measures the runtime of an algorithm, space
          complexity measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to
          the input size. Space complexity is also typically expressed using Big
          O notation. For example, an algorithm that creates an array of size n
          would have O(n) space complexity.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">Conclusion</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Understanding these key terms and concepts is essential for any
          developer looking to analyze and optimize algorithms. By mastering
          time complexity analysis, you'll be better equipped to design
          efficient solutions and make informed decisions about algorithm
          selection in your projects.

          Understanding Worst-Case Time Complexity
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Worst-case time complexity is a crucial concept in algorithm analysis
          that represents the maximum amount of time an algorithm will take to
          complete for any input of a given size. This measure is particularly
          important because it provides a guaranteed upper bound on the
          algorithm's performance, allowing developers to make informed
          decisions about algorithm selection and resource allocation.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">
          Why Worst-Case Analysis Matters
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          While average-case analysis can provide useful insights, worst-case
          analysis is often preferred for several reasons:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
          <li>
            It provides a guaranteed performance bound, which is crucial for
            real-time systems or applications with strict performance
            requirements.
          </li>
          <li>
            It helps in identifying potential bottlenecks or vulnerabilities in
            algorithms that could be exploited by malicious inputs.
          </li>
          <li>
            It's often easier to calculate than average-case complexity, which
            may require assumptions about input distribution.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">
          Calculating Worst-Case Time Complexity
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          To determine the worst-case time complexity of an algorithm, we need
          to:
        </p>
        <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 mb-4">
          <li>Identify the most time-consuming path through the algorithm.</li>
          <li>
            Count the number of basic operations (e.g., comparisons,
            assignments) along this path.
          </li>
          <li>Express this count as a function of the input size.</li>
          <li>
            Simplify the function using Big O notation, focusing on the dominant
            term.
          </li>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">
          Examples of Worst-Case Time Complexity
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Let's consider a few common algorithms and their worst-case time
          complexities:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
          <li>
            <strong>Linear Search:</strong> O(n) - In the worst case, the
            element is at the end of the list or not present.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Binary Search:</strong> O(log n) - Even in the worst case,
            the search space is halved in each step.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Bubble Sort:</strong> O(n²) - The worst case occurs when the
            array is reverse sorted.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Quick Sort:</strong> O(n²) - While average case is O(n log
            n), the worst case occurs with a poorly chosen pivot.
          </li>
        </ul>

          Implications for Algorithm Design
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Understanding worst-case time complexity has significant implications
          for algorithm design and selection:

          The time complexity of binary search is O(log n), where n is the
          number of elements in the array. Here's why:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
          <li>In each step, the search space is halved</li>
          <li>The maximum number of steps is log₂(n) + 1</li>
          <li>
            This logarithmic growth makes binary search extremely efficient for
            large datasets
          </li>
        </ul>

          Introduction to Time Complexity Analysis
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Analyzing the time complexity of your code is a crucial skill for
          writing efficient and scalable software. This guide will walk you
          through the process of evaluating your code's time complexity step by
          step.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">
          Step 1: Identify the Input
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Begin by identifying the input that affects the runtime of your
          algorithm. This is typically denoted as 'n' and represents the size of
          the input data.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">
          Step 2: Count Basic Operations
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Identify and count the basic operations in your code. These include:

          Step 3: Analyze Loops and Recursive Calls
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Loops and recursive calls often dominate the time complexity. Analyze
          them carefully:

          Step 5: Simplify and Express in Big O Notation
